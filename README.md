Welcome to The Digital Scientists @ Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore.

We are a bunch of people that likes to use computers for various aspects of science, where we build tools and tinker around with data in the comforts of our bed or over a cup of ice coffee as our work is not bounded by physical and geographical constraints. Yes, my computer can be doing work while I am sleeping or out meeting my friends. Essentially, we take the view that our computers / laptops are our own personal laboratory.

Digital Scientists (or DiSc for short) is a project / work group than a social club, where members will be trained as experts and act as assistant trainers to conduct workshops for the rest of the school community. Focusing on

preparing students for the future digital workplace / economy in the industry contexts relevant to applied sciences
engaging in digitalization-based research projects and development of educational materials as supplemental learning / enrichment, and
participating in digitalization-related competitions and events (such as hackathons) as means of enrichment and professional networking.
